hipster-robot
=============

A hipster robotic arm that stops you listening to any music it deems "too mainstream".

The hipster-robot is a robotic arm (http://www.maplin.co.uk/p/robotic-arm-kit-with-usb-pc-interface-a37jn) controlled by a Raspberry Pi, which monitors the music playing from Spotify on your laptop. Play any artist currently in the top 100 artist "hot list" (the "top_hottt" API from The Echo Nest), such as Taylor Swift or Just Bieber, and the robot kicks into action, pressing the spacebar on your computer to stop the music playing.
